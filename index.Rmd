## What questions would *you* ask about these sorts of data?

## How could the data be made maximimally useful to other researchers?

## Ideas about seeking additional funding

# How infrastructure can enable open, transparent, and reproducible, "big data" developmental science {data-background=#999999}

## From static repository to dynamic analysis platform

## NSF Research Implementations for Data Intensive Research in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (RIDIR)

<https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18517/nsf18517.htm>

3-4 awards, anticipated funding $4.5 M

Due February 28, 2018

## Our idea

### Aim 1: Enhance Databrary's shared video & audio recordings with new, machine-generated metadata

### Aim 2: Create secure, cloud-based workspace for developing and testing machine learning models on Databrary resources

### Aim 3: Develop robust workflows for automated gaze direction analysis from video

## Aim 1

Collaborate with Tal Yarkoni and adapt his (NIH-funded) [`pliers`](http://tyarkoni.github.io/pliers/index.html) package
 
images/video: faces, objects, visual saliency, indoor/outdoor, text in image

sound: speech/non-speech, sound spectra

---

How to return 'tags' to Databrary in useful form? (time series + summary stats)

Offer tagging of unshared data volumes?

Privacy/confidentiality issues

## Aim 2

### Cloud-based workspace for analysis & visualization

### Linked to Databrary files

### Facilitate convenient `sshfs` or similar file-sharing, version control

### Infrastructure to spawn cloud-based virtual machines to manage computationally intensive analyses

### `Ingest' session metadata from spreadsheets

<!-- ## Aim 3 -->

<!-- Collaborate with [Speech Recognition Virtual Kitchen](http://speechkitchen.org/) scientists -->

<!-- Apply sound categorization filters--"speech/non-speech" -->

<!-- Then speaker category--"adult/child" -->

<!-- Then speech-to-text on videos using [this tool or similar](https://github.com/srvk/eesen-transcriber) -->

## Aim 3

Collaborate with Kim Scott ([LookIt](http://lookit.mit.edu)), Rhodri Cusack and others

Develop and test new ML model from existing tagged training data + eye tracking

## The bigger picture

Bring reproducible machine-assisted video/audio tagging to wider range of behavioral scientists

Make data sharing even more appealing, attractive, valuable

Make psychology a more cumulative science ([Mischel 2009](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/becoming-a-cumulative-science))
